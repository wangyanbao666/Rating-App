# Rating-App
A rating app implemented by python tkinter

## What is it:
It is a simple app to record score of groups. Users can define how many groups and maximum scores they want, by submitting these information users will be able to see the main screen of the app where there are multiple "smiling face" images. Clicking on any "smiling face" will turn the grey color of it and all the images in front of it to orange. By clicking a rightmost orange "smiling face" users can clear the score of that group and turn the orange images back into grey.

## How to use:
Download the project and go to the "dist" directory, an executable file can be found there. Double click the executable file will start the app.
